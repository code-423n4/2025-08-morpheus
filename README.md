**‚ùó Important notes for wardens** 
1. Since this audit includes live/deployed code, **all submissions will be treated as sensitive:**
  - Wardens are encouraged to submit High-risk submissions affecting live code promptly, to ensure timely disclosure of such vulnerabilities to the sponsor and guarantee payout in the case where [a sponsor patches a live critical during the audit](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards#the-live-criticals-exception). 
  - Submissions will be hidden from *all* wardens (SR and non-SR alike) by default, to ensure that no sensitive issues are erroneously shared. 
  - If the submissions include findings affecting live code, there will be no post-judging QA phase. This ensures that awards can be distributed in a timely fashion, without compromising the security of the project. (Senior members of C4 staff will review the judges‚Äô decisions per usual.)
  - By default, submissions will not be made public until the report is published.
  - **Exception:** if the sponsor indicates that no submissions affect live code, then we‚Äôll make submissions visible to all authenticated wardens, and open PJQA to SR wardens per the usual C4 process.
2. A coded, runnable PoC is required for all High/Medium submissions to this audit. 
  - This repo includes a basic template to run the test suite.
  - PoCs must use the test suite provided in this repo.
  - Your submission will be marked as Insufficient if the POC is not runnable and working with the provided test suite.
  - Exception: PoC is optional (though recommended) for wardens with signal ‚â• 0.68.
3. Judging phase risk adjustments (upgrades/downgrades):
  - High- or Medium-risk submissions downgraded by the judge to Low-risk (QA) will be ineligible for awards.
  - Upgrading a Low-risk finding from a QA report to a Medium- or High-risk finding is not supported.
  - As such, wardens are encouraged to select the appropriate risk level carefully during the submission phase.

# Additional context

## Areas of concern (where to focus for bugs)
Main focus on the DepositPool and Distributor contracts:
- we must maintain compatibility with the previous version and avoid introducing vulnerabilities that could lead to funds being locked or lost by stakers.
- we must ensure a highly reliable migration to the new version, without any loss of rewards for stakers (assuming the contract owner will perform the migration properly).
- the reward calculation for new deposit pools should be based on the documentation and requirements.
 - pay close attention to integrations with ChainLink and Aave.

‚úÖ SCOUTS: Please format the response above üëÜ so its not a wall of text and its readable.

## Main invariants

- the new version should use updated reward calculation mechanisms by supporting additional staking tokens.
- the new version must not lock user funds unless this behavior is explicitly defined by the protocol.
- the share of the DepositPool in calculations is taken at the current price of the token in relation to the USD, we do not take into account exchange rate fluctuations between claim, stake or withdraw.
- the data feeds for Chainlink are selected by the contract owner and are considered reliable.
- the shares of all DepositPools must be recalculated when the amount of staked tokens in any deposit pool changes.
